    # ------ Hashing Techniques ------ #

    # Why to use ?
    -> To search array element in O(1) time complexity.

    # This is not a data structure.

    # This is an algorithm/Technique on 'array' data structure.

    # It makes searching faster.

    # It is used to implement hashtable.

    # Hashtable is a array of structure.
    
    # Hashing Technique: 
        1. Division Method (âœ…)
        2. Mid Square Method
        3. Folding Method

    # Collision Resolution Techniques:
        1. Open Hashing (Closed Addressing)
            - Seperate Chaining
        2. Closed Hashing (Open Addressing)
            - Linear Probing
            - Quadratic Probing
            - Double Hashing
    
    # Probe means Search.

    # Most popular hashing technique is -> 'Division Method'

    # Time complexity:
           1.Searching:
                 O(1) -> Best Case
                 O(1) -> Avg Case
                 O(n) -> Worst Case
      
           2.Insertion:
                 O(1) -> Best Case
                 O(1) -> Avg Case
                 O(n) -> Worst Case
            
           3.Deletion:
                 O(1) -> Best Case
                 O(1) -> Avg Case
                 O(n) -> Worst Case
      
           4.Display: -> O(n)
          
           5.Linear Probing:
                 O(1) -> Best Case
                 O(n) -> Avg Case
                 O(n) -> Worst Case
      
           6.Quadratic Probing:
                  O(1)   -> Best Case
                 O(logn) -> Avg Case
                 O(logn) -> Worst Case
      
           6.Double Hashing:
                  O(1)   -> Best Case
                 O(logn) -> Avg Case
                 O(logn) -> Worst Case
